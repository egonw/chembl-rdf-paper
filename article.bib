    abstract = {The paper presents a new method for generating typologies of formal-ontological relations. The guiding idea is that formal relations are those sorts of relations which hold between entities which are constituents of distinct ontologies. We provide examples of ontologies (in the spirit of Zemach's classic "Four Ontologies" of 1970), and show how these can be used to give a rich typology of formal relations in a way which also throws light on the opposition between threeand four-dimensionalism.},

                Malaria is a devastating infection caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. Drug resistance is widespread, no new chemical class of antimalarials has been introduced into clinical practice since 1996 and there is a recent rise of parasite strains with reduced sensitivity to the newest drugs. We screened nearly 2 million compounds in {GlaxoSmithKline}'s chemical library for inhibitors of P. falciparum, of which 13,533 were confirmed to inhibit parasite growth by at least 80\% at 2 {microM} concentration. More than 8,000 also showed potent activity against the multidrug resistant strain Dd2. Most (82\%) compounds originate from internal company projects and are new to the malaria community. Analyses using historic assay data suggest several novel mechanisms of antimalarial action, such as inhibition of protein kinases and host-pathogen interaction related targets. Chemical structures and associated data are hereby made public to encourage additional drug lead identification efforts and further research into this disease.

	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Toxicity is a complex phenomenon involving the potential adverse effect on a range of biological functions. Predicting toxicity involves using a combination of experimental data (endpoints) and computational methods to generate a set of predictive models. Such models rely strongly on being able to integrate information from many sources. The required integration of biological and chemical information sources requires, however, a common language to express our knowledge ontologically, and interoperating services to build reliable predictive toxicology applications.
FINDINGS: This article describes progress in extending the integrative bio- and cheminformatics platform Bioclipse to interoperate with OpenTox, a semantic web framework which supports open data exchange and toxicology model building. The Bioclipse workbench environment enables functionality from OpenTox web services and easy access to OpenTox resources for evaluating toxicity properties of query molecules. Relevant cases and interfaces based on ten neurotoxins are described to demonstrate the capabilities provided to the user. The integration takes advantage of semantic web technologies, thereby providing an open and simplifying communication standard. Additionally, the use of ontologies ensures proper interoperation and reliable integration of toxicity information from both experimental and computational sources.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel computational toxicity assessment platform was generated from integration of two open science platforms related to toxicology: Bioclipse, that combines a rich scriptable and graphical workbench environment for integration of diverse sets of information sources, and OpenTox, a platform for interoperable toxicology data and computational services. The combination provides improved reliability and operability for handling large data sets by the use of the Open Standards from the OpenTox Application Programming Interface. This enables simultaneous access to a variety of distributed predictive toxicology databases, and algorithm and model resources, taking advantage of the Bioclipse workbench handling the technical layers.},

	Abstract = {Chemical liabilities, such as adverse effects and toxicity, have a major impact on today's drug discovery process. In silico prediction of chemical liabilities is an important approach which can reduce costs and animal testing by complementing or replacing in vitro and in vivo liability models. There is a lack of integrated, extensible decision support systems for chemical liability assessment which run quickly and have easily interpretable results. Here we present a method which integrates similarity searches, structural alerts, and QSAR models which all are available from the Bioclipse workbench. Emphasis has been placed on interpretation of results, and substructures which are important for predictions are highlighted in the original chemical structures. This allows for interactively changing chemical structures with instant visual feedback and can be used for hypothesis testing of single chemical structures as well as compound collections. The system has a clear separation between methods and data, and the extensible architecture enables straightforward extension via addition of more plugins (such as new data sets and computational models). We demonstrate our method on three important safety end points: mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation. Bioclipse and the decision support implementation are free, open source, and available from http://www.bioclipse.net/decision-support .},

	with a configuration that includes a large number of current biological

	ability to transparently use both private and public datasets in

	Abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on
	different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format
	for the web, these databases are still available in various formats.
	With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and
	the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is
	a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of
	bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built
	from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore
	technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public
	bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several
	of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through
	a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The
	Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology
	to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of
	RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a
	common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build
	mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this
	new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore
	the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's
	disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

@article{Hastings2011,
	Abstract = {Cheminformatics is the application of informatics techniques to solve
	chemical problems in silico. There are many areas in biology where
	cheminformatics plays an important role in computational research,
	including metabolism, proteomics, and systems biology. One critical
	aspect in the application of cheminformatics in these fields is the
	accurate exchange of data, which is increasingly accomplished through
	the use of ontologies. Ontologies are formal representations of objects
	and their properties using a logic-based ontology language. Many
	such ontologies are currently being developed to represent objects
	across all the domains of science. Ontologies enable the definition,
	classification, and support for querying objects in a particular
	domain, enabling intelligent computer applications to be built which
	support the work of scientists both within the domain of interest
	and across interrelated neighbouring domains. Modern chemical research
	relies on computational techniques to filter and organise data to
	maximise research productivity. The objects which are manipulated
	in these algorithms and procedures, as well as the algorithms and
	procedures themselves, enjoy a kind of virtual life within computers.
	We will call these information entities. Here, we describe our work
	in developing an ontology of chemical information entities, with
	a primary focus on data-driven research and the integration of calculated
	properties (descriptors) of chemical entities within a semantic web
	context. Our ontology distinguishes algorithmic, or procedural information
	from declarative, or factual information, and renders of particular
	importance the annotation of provenance to calculated data. The Chemical
	Information Ontology is being developed as an open collaborative
	project. More details, together with a downloadable {OWL} file, are
	available at http://code.google.com/p/semanticchemist​ry/ (license:

	have already been used for more than a decade in molecular sciences,
	but have not found widespread use yet. The semantic web technology
	Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) and related methods show to
	be sufficiently versatile to change that situation. {RESULTS} : The
	work presented here focuses on linking {RDF} approaches to existing
	molecular chemometrics fields, including cheminformatics, {QSAR}

@article{Visser2011,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:High-throughput screening ({HTS}) is one of the main strategies to identify novel entry points for the development of small molecule chemical probes and drugs and is now commonly accessible to public sector research. Large amounts of data generated in {HTS} campaigns are submitted to public repositories such as {PubChem}, which is growing at an exponential rate. The diversity and quantity of available {HTS} assays and screening results pose enormous challenges to organizing, standardizing, integrating, and analyzing the datasets and thus to maximize the scientific and ultimately the public health impact of the huge investments made to implement public sector {HTS} capabilities. Novel approaches to organize, standardize and access {HTS} data are required to address these {challenges.RESULTS}:We developed the first ontology to describe {HTS} experiments and screening results using expressive description logic. The {BioAssay} Ontology ({BAO}) serves as a foundation for the standardization of {HTS} assays and data and as a semantic knowledge model. In this paper we show important examples of formalizing {HTS} domain knowledge and we point out the advantages of this approach. The ontology is available online at the {NCBO} bioportal http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/44531 {webcite.CONCLUSIONS}:After a large manual curation effort, we loaded {BAO}-mapped data triples into a {RDF} database store and used a reasoner in several case studies to demonstrate the benefits of formalized domain knowledge representation in {BAO}. The examples illustrate semantic querying capabilities where {BAO} enables the retrieval of inferred search results that are relevant to a given query, but are not explicitly defined. {BAO} thus opens new functionality for annotating, querying, and analyzing {HTS} datasets and the potential for discovering new knowledge by means of inference.},

We previously developed an {RDF}-based resource called {Chem2Bio2RDF} that enabled querying of such data using the {SPARQL} query language. Whilst this work has proved useful in its own right as one of the first major resources in these disciplines, its utility could be greatly improved by the application of an ontology for annotation of the nodes and edges in the {RDF} graph, enabling a much richer range of semantic queries to be {issued.RESULTS}:We developed a generalized chemogenomics and systems chemical biology {OWL} ontology called {Chem2Bio2OWL} that describes the semantics of chemical compounds, drugs, protein targets, pathways, genes, diseases and side-effects, and the relationships between them. The ontology also includes data provenance. We used it to annotate our {Chem2Bio2RDF} dataset, making it a rich semantic resource.

    abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and biology provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining for drug discovery. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous sets and provision of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets would permit investigation of complex mechanisms of action of drugs. In this work we integrated and annotated data from public datasets relating to drugs, chemical compounds, protein targets, diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects. Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision. Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for 157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and measured their similarity using a score matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not captured by structural similarity, with several potential new drug pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel, validated alternative to existing drug target prediction algorithms. The web service is freely available at: http://chem2bio2rdf.org/slap. Modern drug discovery requires the understanding of chemogenomics, the complex interaction of chemical compounds and drugs with a wide variety of protein target and genes in the body. A large amount of data pertaining to such relationships exists in publicly-accessible datasets but it is siloed and thus impossible to use in an integrated fashion. In this work we have integrated and semantically annotated a large amount of public data from a wide range of databases, including compound-gene, drug-drug, protein-protein, drug-side effects and so on, to create a complex network of interactions relating to compounds and protein targets. We developed a statistical algorithm called Semantic Link Association Prediction ({SLAP}) for predicting  ” missing links” in this data network: i.e. compound-target interactions for which there is no experimental data but which are statistically probable given the other relationships that exist in this set. We present validation experiments which show this method works with a high degree of accuracy, and also demonstrate how it can be used to create a drug similarity network to make predictions of new indications for existing drugs.},
