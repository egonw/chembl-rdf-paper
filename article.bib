  abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on
	different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format
	for the web, these databases are still available in various formats.
	With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and
	the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is
	a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of
	bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built
	from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore
	technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public
	bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several
	of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through
	a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The
	Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology
	to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of
	RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a
	common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build
	mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this
	new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore
	the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's
	disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Systems chemical biology and chemogenomics are considered
	critical, integrative disciplines in modern biomedical research,
	but require data mining of large, integrated, heterogeneous datasets
	from chemistry and biology. We previously developed an {RDF}-based
	resource called {Chem2Bio2RDF} that enabled querying of such data
	using the {SPARQL} query language. Whilst this work has proved useful
	in its own right as one of the first major resources in these disciplines,
	its utility could be greatly improved by the application of an ontology
	for annotation of the nodes and edges in the {RDF} graph, enabling
	a much richer range of semantic queries to be {issued.RESULTS}:We
	developed a generalized chemogenomics and systems chemical biology
	{OWL} ontology called {Chem2Bio2OWL} that describes the semantics
	of chemical compounds, drugs, protein targets, pathways, genes, diseases
	and side-effects, and the relationships between them. The ontology
	also includes data provenance. We used it to annotate our {Chem2Bio2RDF}
	dataset, making it a rich semantic resource. Through a series of
	scientific case studies we demonstrate how this (i) simplifies the
	process of building {SPARQL} queries, (ii) enables useful new kinds
	of queries on the data and (iii) makes possible intelligent reasoning

  abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and biology
	provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining for drug discovery.
	Systematic integration of these heterogeneous sets and provision
	of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets would permit investigation
	of complex mechanisms of action of drugs. In this work we integrated
	and annotated data from public datasets relating to drugs, chemical
	compounds, protein targets, diseases, side effects and pathways,
	building a semantic linked network consisting of over 290,000 nodes
	and 720,000 edges. We developed a statistical model to assess the
	association of drug target pairs based on their relation with other
	linked objects. Validation experiments demonstrate the model can
	correctly identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision.
	Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene expression
	level) are also identified but not as strongly as direct pairs. We
	further calculated the association scores for 157 drugs from 10 disease
	areas against 1683 human targets, and measured their similarity using
	a score matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from
	the same disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not
	captured by structural similarity, with several potential new drug
	pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel, validated
	alternative to existing drug target prediction algorithms. The web
	service is freely available at: http://chem2bio2rdf.org/slap. Modern
	drug discovery requires the understanding of chemogenomics, the complex
	interaction of chemical compounds and drugs with a wide variety of
	protein target and genes in the body. A large amount of data pertaining
	to such relationships exists in publicly-accessible datasets but
	it is siloed and thus impossible to use in an integrated fashion.
	In this work we have integrated and semantically annotated a large
	amount of public data from a wide range of databases, including compound-gene,
	drug-drug, protein-protein, drug-side effects and so on, to create
	a complex network of interactions relating to compounds and protein
	targets. We developed a statistical algorithm called Semantic Link
	Association Prediction ({SLAP}) for predicting ” missing links” in
	this data network: i.e. compound-target interactions for which there
	is no experimental data but which are statistically probable given
	the other relationships that exist in this set. We present validation
	experiments which show this method works with a high degree of accuracy,
	and also demonstrate how it can be used to create a drug similarity
	network to make predictions of new indications for existing drugs.},

  abstract = {Cheminformatics is the application of informatics techniques to solve
	chemical problems in silico. There are many areas in biology where
	cheminformatics plays an important role in computational research,
	including metabolism, proteomics, and systems biology. One critical
	aspect in the application of cheminformatics in these fields is the
	accurate exchange of data, which is increasingly accomplished through
	the use of ontologies. Ontologies are formal representations of objects
	and their properties using a logic-based ontology language. Many
	such ontologies are currently being developed to represent objects
	across all the domains of science. Ontologies enable the definition,
	classification, and support for querying objects in a particular
	domain, enabling intelligent computer applications to be built which
	support the work of scientists both within the domain of interest
	and across interrelated neighbouring domains. Modern chemical research
	relies on computational techniques to filter and organise data to
	maximise research productivity. The objects which are manipulated
	in these algorithms and procedures, as well as the algorithms and
	procedures themselves, enjoy a kind of virtual life within computers.
	We will call these information entities. Here, we describe our work
	in developing an ontology of chemical information entities, with
	a primary focus on data-driven research and the integration of calculated
	properties (descriptors) of chemical entities within a semantic web
	context. Our ontology distinguishes algorithmic, or procedural information
	from declarative, or factual information, and renders of particular
	importance the annotation of provenance to calculated data. The Chemical
	Information Ontology is being developed as an open collaborative
	project. More details, together with a downloadable {OWL} file, are

	testing of single chemical structures as well as compound collections.
	The system has a clear separation between methods and data, and the

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:High-throughput screening ({HTS}) is one of the main
	strategies to identify novel entry points for the development of
	small molecule chemical probes and drugs and is now commonly accessible
	to public sector research. Large amounts of data generated in {HTS}
	campaigns are submitted to public repositories such as {PubChem},
	which is growing at an exponential rate. The diversity and quantity
	of available {HTS} assays and screening results pose enormous challenges
	to organizing, standardizing, integrating, and analyzing the datasets
	and thus to maximize the scientific and ultimately the public health
	impact of the huge investments made to implement public sector {HTS}
	capabilities. Novel approaches to organize, standardize and access
	{HTS} data are required to address these {challenges.RESULTS}:We
	developed the first ontology to describe {HTS} experiments and screening
	results using expressive description logic. The {BioAssay} Ontology
	({BAO}) serves as a foundation for the standardization of {HTS} assays
	and data and as a semantic knowledge model. In this paper we show
	important examples of formalizing {HTS} domain knowledge and we point
	out the advantages of this approach. The ontology is available online

	domain knowledge representation in {BAO}. The examples illustrate
	semantic querying capabilities where {BAO} enables the retrieval
	of inferred search results that are relevant to a given query, but
	are not explicitly defined. {BAO} thus opens new functionality for
	annotating, querying, and analyzing {HTS} datasets and the potential

  journal = {BMC Res Notes},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {487},
  abstract = {UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Toxicity is a complex phenomenon
	involving the potential adverse effect on a range of biological functions.
	Predicting toxicity involves using a combination of experimental
	data (endpoints) and computational methods to generate a set of predictive
	models. Such models rely strongly on being able to integrate information
	from many sources. The required integration of biological and chemical
	information sources requires, however, a common language to express
	our knowledge ontologically, and interoperating services to build
	reliable predictive toxicology applications. FINDINGS: This article
	describes progress in extending the integrative bio- and cheminformatics
	platform Bioclipse to interoperate with OpenTox, a semantic web framework
	which supports open data exchange and toxicology model building.
	The Bioclipse workbench environment enables functionality from OpenTox
	web services and easy access to OpenTox resources for evaluating
	toxicity properties of query molecules. Relevant cases and interfaces
	based on ten neurotoxins are described to demonstrate the capabilities
	provided to the user. The integration takes advantage of semantic
	web technologies, thereby providing an open and simplifying communication
	standard. Additionally, the use of ontologies ensures proper interoperation
	and reliable integration of toxicity information from both experimental
	and computational sources. CONCLUSIONS: A novel computational toxicity
	assessment platform was generated from integration of two open science
	platforms related to toxicology: Bioclipse, that combines a rich
	scriptable and graphical workbench environment for integration of
	diverse sets of information sources, and OpenTox, a platform for
	interoperable toxicology data and computational services. The combination
	provides improved reliability and operability for handling large
	data sets by the use of the Open Standards from the OpenTox Application
	Programming Interface. This enables simultaneous access to a variety
	of distributed predictive toxicology databases, and algorithm and
	model resources, taking advantage of the Bioclipse workbench handling
