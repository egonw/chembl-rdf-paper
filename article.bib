  abstract = {Scientists need to transfer semantically similar queries across multiple
	heterogeneous linked datasets. These queries may require data from
	different locations and the results are not simple to combine due
	to differences between datasets. A query model was developed to make
	it simple to distribute queries across different datasets using RDF
	as the result format. The query model, based on the concept of publicly
	recognised namespaces for parts of each scientific dataset, was implemented
	with a configuration that includes a large number of current biological
	and chemical datasets. The configuration is flexible, providing the
	ability to transparently use both private and public datasets in
	any query. A prototype implementation of the model was used to resolve
	queries for the Bio2RDF website, including both Bio2RDF datasets
	and other datasets that do not follow the Bio2RDF URI conventions.},

  abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on
	different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format
	for the web, these databases are still available in various formats.
	With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and
	the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is
	a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of
	bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built
	from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore
	technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public
	bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several
	of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through
	a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The
	Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology
	to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of
	RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a
	common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build
	mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this
	new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore
	the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's
	disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

  abstract = {There is an abundance of information about drugs available on the
	Web. Data sources range from medicinal chemistry results, over the
	impact of drugs on gene expression, to the outcomes of drugs in clinical
	trials. These data are typically not connected together, which reduces
	the ease with which insights can be gained. Linking Open Drug Data
	(LODD) is a task force within the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C)
	Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLS IG). LODD has
	surveyed publicly available data about drugs, created Linked Data
	representations of the data sets, and identified interesting scientific
	and business questions that can be answered once the data sets are
	connected. The task force provides recommendations for the best practices
	of exposing data in a Linked Data representation. In this paper,
	we present past and ongoing work of LODD and discuss the growing
	importance of Linked Data as a foundation for pharmaceutical R&D
	data sharing.},

	every 3 weeks and can be accessed online for searches or download
